# Unit 1

## Applications of AI
1. AI in E-Commerce:
  - Revolutionizes retail with personalized recommendation engines
  - Chatbots offer human-like shopping experience using Natural Language Processing
  - Detecting Fraud

2. AI in Education
  - Grading, Feedback Facilitations, Enrollment Management, HR-Related tasks
  - Digitizes video lectures, conferences and guides
  - Monitoring Student's data, study habits and generating customized lesson plan, reminders, and study guides

3. AI in Automobile
  - Self-driving cars, having cameras, radars, GPS and control signals, also include emergency braking, blind spot monitoring
  - Automobile assembly, Supply Chain management
  - Reducing distractions, analyze behaviours and providing in car delivery services

4. Misc applications
  - AI powered robots use real time updates to plan journeys
  - AI-driven software for blind hiring
  - Revolutionizing healthcare by faster diagnosis, personalized treatment plans and drug discovery

## Features of Machine Learning
1. Uses the data to detect patterns in a dataset and adjust program actions accordingly
2. Focuses on the development of computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data
3. Enables computers to find hidden insights using iterative algorithms without being explicitly programmed
4. Automates analytical model building using statistical and machine learning algorithms

## Types of ML
1. __Supervised Learning:__ Algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where it learns to map input data to corresponding output labels. Classification and Regression
2. __Unsupervised Learning:__ Algo is given unlabeled dataset and it tries to find patterns and relationships within the data
3. __Semi-supervied Learning:__ Combines elements of both the above categories. Small labeled set and a larger unlabeled dataset
4. __Reinforcement Learning:__ Agent learns to interact with the environment to achieve a goal. Feedback in rewards or penalties and adjusts actions.

## Advantages of AI
1. __Reduction in Human Error__
2. __Takes risks instead of humans:__ Send bots with AI to Chernobyl
3. __Repetetive Tasks:__ Can redo the same stuff without complaining of beingn bored
4. __Digital Assistance:__ Setup a voice bot or chat bot that helps customers
5. __Daily Applications:__ Siri, Cortana, Alexa are used in daily routine
6. __New Inventions:__ Doctors can now predict cancer in earlier stages with help of AI

## Disadvantages of Ai
1. __High Costs of Creation:__ Hardware and software updates to meet latest requirements, causing significant expenses
2. __Unemployment:__ Replacing human taskforce with AI
3. __Lack of Creativity:__ Machines can only do what they are programmed and cannot be asked to think
4. __Lack of Emotions:__ They cannot replace the connection that humans have when they are in a team
