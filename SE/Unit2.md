# Unit 2

## Software Project Management
- Software Projects are temporary individual or collaborative enterprises that are carefully planned to achieve a particular aim

### Characteristics of Software Projects
- Consists of interrelated activites
- Need adequate resources
- Intangible
- Have certain activities which are not repeated under any circumstance
- Goal specific
- Sequence of activities

|Software Project Managemet|Project Management|
|:--:|:--:|
|Art and discipline of planning and supervising software projects|It facilitates the project workflow with team collaboration on a single project|
|Activities towards planning, execution of plans, monitoring and controlling project|Planning, organizing, motivating, controlling the resources to achieve specific project goals, monitoring, risk management etc.|

### Quality of Project
- Is to achieve project goals and targets whilel keeping in mind the __scope__, __time__, __quality__ and cost
- Project Management will need to maintain this triad to remain in equilibrium

### Project Management Life Cycle
1. Initiation and Approval
2. Planning
3. Monitoring Execution and Control
4. Closing

### Software Development Life Cycle
1. Requirements Engineering
2. Architecture
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deploy

#### Initiation
- This is the point where opportunity or reason for the project has been identitifies
- Project is initiated after the _"go"_ after the feasibility study
- What is done  during this phase?
  - Project charter is created
  - Project charter outlines purpose, structure and execution of the project
  - Detailing out the responsibilities of the project teams and the stakeholders
  - Initial Project Owner/Manager is identified
  - Initial budget is identified
  - Identification of resources

#### Project Planning
1. Understanding the project
2. Planning the project
3. Organize the project
4. Determining deliverables
5. Work Breakdown Structure
6. Scheduling and Allocating resources
7. Identifying and Managing risks
8. Developing a quality management process for Dev
9. Delivery plan planning to manage the plan

#### Project Monitoring and Control
- Process is continnuously performed and encompasses all the tasks and uses all the measures and metrics necessary to ensure that the project is on track
- __Monitoring:__ Using Quantitative Data which is continuously collected all along the project
- __Control:__ Making decisions or adjustments in dimensions like time or cost

#### Project Closure
1. Hand over deliverables + User Acceptance Test sign off
2. Finish documentation
3. Post implementation review
4. Release staff and equipment + inform stakeholders of closure


## Software Project Planning
- First task in a project
- Project Manager focusses on __what__ and __how__
- The outcome is the Project Plan
  - Depends on nature of the project
  - Project plan can evolve over the lifecycle of the project
- Three perspectives:
  - Sponsor's Perspective
  - Customer's Perspective
  - Execution Stakeholder's Perspective

### Execution Stakeholder's Perspective
- What lifecycle are we gonna follow
- Criteria for prioritizing of requirements
- Project Organizaion
  - Relationships to other parts of organization
  - Roles of people
  - User involvement
- Standards to follow
- Communication Mechanisms
- Schedule with Detailed Work Breakdown and Ownership


### Steps in Project Planning
#### Developing a quality management process
- Plan for progress tracking of the project
- Communication plans
- Quality Assurance plans
- Test completin criteria
- Early verification

#### Plans for tracking Project Plan & Delivery Plan
- Plan for management of Project Plan
- Procedures for release of product to customer
- Staff and people management
- Performance management
- Compensation and benefits management

### Outcomes and Roles
- Outcomes of Project Planning
  - Project Plan
  - Resource Management
  - Work Break down
  - Plans for communication metrics
  - Schedule
  - Risk Management Plan
- Roles
  - Project Management
  - Project Manager

## Proect Monitoring and Control
- Processes performed to observe project execution so that potential problems can be identified in a timely manner
- Project control activites involves making decisions or adjustments in dimensions like time, cost etc
- Dimensions:
  - Time
  - Information
  - Organization
  - Quality
  - Cost & Infrastructure

### Time
- In terms of effort and the schedules
- Measuring progress is hard
- Development models serve to manage time
- More people does not mean less time

### Information
- Includes availability, propogation, communication and documentation
- Technical documentation
- Current state of projects
- Changes agreed upon

### Organization
- Involves structure, roles and responsibilities from people and team aspects
- Building a teaem
- Reorganizing structures
- Clarifying, managing expectations and reorienting roles
- Coordination of work

### Quality
- It is not an add-on feature; it has to be built in
- Quality has to be designed in, not an afterthought
- Quality requirements often conflict
- Requires frequent interaction with stakeholders

### Cost and Infrastructure
- Includes personnel capital and expenses
- What factors influence cost?
- What influences productivity
- Relation between cost and schedule

## Architecture
- ___Architectural Design:___ Describes how softeare is decomposed and organized into components
- ___Detailed Design:___ Describes the specific behaviour of components identified during architectural design
- Well written software will be more maintainable
- ___Mastering Software Development:___
  - Learn rules
  - Learn principles
  - Study architectural and design patterns of other projects
  - Patterns must be understood and applied repeatedly

### Software Architecture
- Top level decompositino into major components with a characterization of how components interact
- Software architecture of computing system can be
  - Used for communication among stakeholders
  - Blueprint for system and project under development
  - Used for negotiations and balancing of functional and quality goals happen during architecture

#### Importance of Architecture
- Architecture manifests the earliest set of design decisions
  - Constraints on implementation
  - Dictates organizational structure
  - Inhibits or enables quality attributes and suports WBS
- Supports reuse at architectural level
- Helps in work breakdown and structures in the development
- Changes to architecture is expensive later in the SDLC

#### Characteristics of Software Architecture
- Addresses variety of stakeholder perspectives
- Realized all of the use cases ans scenarios for the problem
- Supports separation of concerns
- Quality Driven
- Recurring Styles
- Conceptual Integrity

#### Factors that influence Software Architecture
- Functional Requirements
- Data Profile
- Audience
- Usage characteristics
- Business priority
- Regulatory and Legal Obligations
- Architectural Standards
- Dependencies and Integration
- Cost Constraints
- Initial State
- Architect and staff skill level
- Technical and Organizational environment
- Technology Constraints

### Architect
- Role within the software development organization structure, who makes high level design choices and dictates technical standards
- Architect has:
  - Distinct role in project
  - Broad Training & Extensive Experience
  - Deep Understanding of the domain

#### Views
- Represent ways of describing the Software Architecture, enabling the system to be viewed by different stakeholders in perspectives of their interest
- Ex: UI View, Process View

#### Styles
- Demos how the subsystems or elements are organized
- Way of organizing code
- Ex: Pipe & Filters, Client-Server, Peer-to-Peer

#### Pattern
- Known or proven solution to the architectural problem of structuring and functioning of the subsystems
- Ex: MVC separating UI from the rest

### Design Issues and Decisions
- Designer makes a design decision to resolve design issues faced
- Design Decision: Process involves choosing the best option among the alternatives

### Theme - Decomposition
- First step typically involves decomposition of the problem to individual modules
- Approaches:
  - Decomposition based on _Layering_
  - Decomposition based on _Distribution of resources_
  - Decomposition based on _Exposure_
  - Decomposition based on _Functionality_
  - Decomposition based on _Generality_
  - Decomposition based on _Volatility_
  - Configuration
- Keeping internals of a module together: ___Coupling___
- Different Modules working together: ___Cohesion___
- Look for __Low Coupling__ and __High Cohesion__
- Other ways of Decomposition:
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Stepwise Refinement
  - Top Down Approach
  - Bottom Up Approach
  - Information Hiding
